# ML_Assignment_project
The aim of this project was to conduct EDA and apply 4 linear models on the california housing data from the sklearn dataset module. Intially, the models were created individually and were referred to as the baseline models. The dataset was heavily skewed, but removing the outliers would make the model significantly less accurate. So, my teammate and I decided to normalize the dataset and log the variables that were heavilty skewed (learned this concept from Introduction to Econometrics @ Fordham University). I made a basic pipeline that would iterate the process of fitting the models and evaulating them in a 'for' loop. Throughout the process, the focus was on improving the r^2 of the model. However, after presenting the project, Professor Sarbanes strongly reccomended to focus on imporing MSE of the models. In the second iteration of the project, I will try to hyparameter tune the models with the lowest MSE and make better use of pipelines.
